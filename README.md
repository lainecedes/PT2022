# Radiance
Welcome to my repository for Project Tech! In this project, I am making a matching application for the app Radiance.

# What is Radiance?
Radiance is a matchmaking app where people can match each other based on skincare and beauty. In this app, people can find each other based on the filter feature, with 3 filters to choose from: gender, skintype and favorite skincare.

This app is for mobile screens (made on size iPhone XR), and is mostly responsive.

# Getting started
